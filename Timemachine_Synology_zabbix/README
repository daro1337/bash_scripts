# Script for checking  outdated timemachine backup on synology NAS.
# Default check is every 2hours if u want more check, compare crontab to zabbix template.
# e.g for 2hours check in zabbix template set backup:timemachine_outdated.0.nodata(7300)}=0  (73000 =2h)
# for 1 hour set 3600 and so on.

#WHAT to do:

#Synology:

1. Allow ssh connection to your  Synology NAS
2. Create new user for backup check like "bckcheck" and grant him Administrator rights or create new group 
'ssh' and from CLI allow this group for ssh connection. If u dont know linux system and CLI, just log in as 
Admin to avoid destroing your Synology.
3. Turn on "home directory for users" on your synology NAS.

#zabbix server

4. create ssh-keys for zabbix user on zabbix server from link below:
https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/2.0/manual/config/items/itemtypes/ssh_checks 
5.  check and remove "#" location of external scripts in zabbix_server.conf e.g 
"ExternalScripts=/usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts"
6. deploy in this directory script tmcheck.sh
7. set crontab (crontab -e)
"0       */2     *       *       *       zabbix /usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts/./tmcheck.sh"
8. import template  to zabbix frontend.
9. if you dont want to wait, make first check manually by typing on zabbix server:
"sudo -H -u zabbix bash -c '/usr/lib/zabbix/externalscripts/./tmcheck.sh'"
